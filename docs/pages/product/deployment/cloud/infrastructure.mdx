# Infrastructure Types

Cube Cloud provides three options for infrastructure deployment:

* [Fully managed](#fully-managed) - data in motion, data at rest is on the Cube side.
* [Fully managed with dedicated pre-aggregation storage)(#dedicated-pre-aggregation-storage) - 
data in motion is on the Cube side, and data at rest is on the customer side.
* [Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC)](#byoc) - both data in motion and data at rest 
are on the customer side.


## Fully managed

This is the most common deployment option, and it is both secure and easy to use.
In this scenario, everything is deployed on the Cube Cloud infrastructure in
one of our **Shared** or [Dedicated][ref-dedicated-vpc] VPCs. Cube Cloud
Control Plane takes care of creating, scaling, and monitoring your Cube
Deployments, as well as managing Cube Store and persisting pre-aggregated data.
This option requires the least effort to set up and is available on all pricing plans.

## Dedicated Pre-Aggregation Storage

On the (Enterprise Premiere)[https://cube.dev/pricing] plan, Cube Cloud offers
an additional option that allows moving all data at rest to the customer
infrastructure. In this scenario, all Cube components reside on the Cube Cloud
side. However, Cube Store uses a customer-provided object store for reading and
persisting pre-aggregated data. This provides additional peace of mind when
processing highly critical business or personal information.

## BYOC

Bring Your Own Cloud, or BYOC is the-highest tier deployment option designed to
meet strict compliance requirements. In the BYOC scenario, all Cube Cloud
components interacting with data are pushed over to the customer side while
still being managed by the Cube Cloud Control Plane. BYOC provides the highest
levels of security without sacrificing the power of management and development
tools provided by Cube Cloud. The BYOC option requires hands-on deployment
and is only available on the (Enterprise Premier)[https://cube.dev/pricing] plan.
